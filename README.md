Client teams that support GitHub Copilot Extensions today are Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Chat in GitHub.com, and Chat in GitHub Mobile. You can see a list of all supported clients [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions#supported-clients-and-ides).

If your feedback is specific to Copilot Extensions in a specific IDE or surface (e.g. client side capabilities, IDE related bugs) please follow these steps:

   - Use the slug name as the label if your feedback is intended for the publisher of that extension.

2. **Create a GitHub Issue in this repository**: 
   - Navigate to the "Issues" tab in this repository.
   - Click on "New Issue" and describe your feedback in detail.
   - Apply the appropriate label using the extension’s slug name.

3. **Engage with builderes**: After submitting your issue, the extension builders may respond to gather more details or provide updates. Keep an eye on the issue thread for any follow-up.

4. **Stay organized**: Ensure your feedback is directed to the specific Copilot Extension by applying the corresponding label. For status updates, you can turn on Issue notifications in the right-hand sidebar.
